## 📘 Overview
In Part 2 of the assignment, I demonstrated AutoGluon’s flexibility using four lightweight examples — **classification, regression, multimodal tabular**, and **automatic feature engineering**.  
Each demo was designed to show how AutoGluon can automatically handle different machine-learning tasks with minimal code.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Installed and imported AutoGluon.  
2. Ran 4 short demos:
   - **Classification** — Adult Income dataset from OpenML  
   - **Regression** — California Housing dataset  
   - **Multimodal Tabular** — Numeric + text data for spending prediction  
   - **Automatic Feature Engineering** — Feature importances and transformations  
3. Used `TabularPredictor` with short training times (`time_limit = 60–120s`).  
4. Displayed model leaderboards and predictions for each demo.
