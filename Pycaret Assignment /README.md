# 🧠 PyCaret Assignment

This repository contains my complete **PyCaret Machine Learning Assignment**, showcasing different ML workflows implemented using **PyCaret**, a low-code machine learning library in Python.

Each folder represents a separate task from the assignment, including data preprocessing, model creation, evaluation, and result saving.

## 📁 Project Structure

| Folder | Task | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Anomaly Detection** | Unsupervised | Detecting unusual patterns using Isolation Forest |
| **Association Rules Mining** | Market Basket Analysis | Finding relationships between purchased items |
| **Binary Classification** | Supervised | Predicting binary outcomes (e.g., survival) |
| **Clustering** | Unsupervised | Grouping similar data points using K-Means |
| **Multiclass Classification** | Supervised | Predicting multi-category outcomes (e.g., flower species) |
| **Regression** | Supervised | Predicting continuous numeric values (e.g., house prices) |
| **Time Series** | Forecasting | Predicting future values based on historical data |

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- **PyCaret 3.3.2**
- **Python 3.11**
- **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **mlxtend**, **gradio**
- **Kaggle / Colab** notebooks for implementation

## 📊 Summary
Each notebook demonstrates an end-to-end ML pipeline:
1. Loading and cleaning data  
2. Setting up the PyCaret environment  
3. Comparing models automatically  
4. Evaluating the best model  
5. Saving outputs (models, predictions, and visualizations)
