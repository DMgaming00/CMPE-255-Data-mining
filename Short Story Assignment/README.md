# 🌍 Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Data Science
*A Tutorial and Survey — CMPE 255 Short Story Assignment*

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains my individual project for the **CMPE 255 Short Story Assignment** at **San José State University (SJSU)**.  
The topic is based on the survey paper:

> **"Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Data Science: A Tutorial and Survey"**  
> *by Yuxuan Liang et al., 2025 (arXiv:2503.13502)*  

The paper explores how **Foundation Models (like GPT or BERT)** can be applied to understand data that changes over **space** and **time**, such as traffic patterns, weather systems, and human mobility.  
It provides a comprehensive review of how these models are transforming the fields of **data mining**, **machine learning**, **urban computing**, and **climate forecasting**.

## 🧠 Project Summary

### 🧩 What Are Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs)?
**Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs)** are large, pre-trained AI models built to understand and predict data that evolves across both **time** and **space**.  

They combine three key abilities:
1. **Perception** — recognizing patterns and correlations in data.  
2. **Optimization** — improving systems such as transportation and climate forecasting.  
3. **Reasoning** — making logical, explainable decisions from complex data.  

---

### ⚙️ Why They Matter
Traditional deep learning models usually focus on one task at a time and need lots of labeled data.  
**STFMs**, inspired by **large language models (LLMs)**, can:
- Adapt to new tasks with minimal training.  
- Learn from multiple data types (text, maps, sensors, videos).  
- Enable intelligent decision-making in real-world systems like smart cities, weather prediction, and disaster management.

### 🔍 Paper Highlights
- Provides the **first complete survey** of Foundation Models across all parts of spatio-temporal (ST) data science:
  1. **Data Sensing** — collecting real-world and synthetic ST data.  
  2. **Data Management** — cleaning, organizing, and integrating large, messy datasets.  
  3. **Data Mining** — using models to discover patterns, trends, and anomalies.  
  4. **Applications** — solving problems like forecasting, event detection, and decision-making.  
- Discusses the two major types of models:
  - **LLM-based Models** (e.g., UrbanGPT, TrafficGPT)  
  - **Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs)** (e.g., ClimaX, Pangu, UniST)  
- Highlights future challenges such as multimodal learning, interpretability, and scalability.
