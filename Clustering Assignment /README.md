# Clustering Assignment

This project contains the complete implementation, documentation, datasets, and results for all nine parts of the Clustering Assignment.  
Each part includes:

- **Notebook** – the Google Colab/Jupyter notebook for that section  
- **Dataset** – the dataset used for clustering (original or custom-generated)  
- **Report** – a summary write-up for the part  
- **Screenshots** – screenshots of notebook output, visualizations, and results  

The assignment is organized into nine independent modules:

- **Part A** – K-Means Clustering (from scratch)  
- **Part B** – Hierarchical Clustering  
- **Part C** – Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)  
- **Part D** – DBSCAN (sklearn version)  
- **Part E** – Anomaly Detection with PyOD  
- **Part F** – Time-Series Clustering  
- **Part G** – Document Clustering using LLM Embeddings  
- **Part H** – Image Clustering using ResNet Embeddings  
- **Part I** – Audio Clustering using MFCC Embeddings  

You can open each part individually to view the notebook, dataset, and written report.
