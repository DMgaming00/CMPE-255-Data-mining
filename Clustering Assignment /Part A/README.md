# Part A – K-Means Clustering (From Scratch)

This folder contains all materials for Part A of the clustering assignment.

## Contents
- **Dataset/** – dataset used for K-Means (Iris or custom)
- **Notebook/** – implementation of K-Means from scratch in NumPy
- **Report/** – one-paragraph summary and explanations
- **Screenshots/** – PCA visualizations, terminal output, and cluster plots

## Description
In this part, K-Means clustering is implemented manually without using scikit-learn.  
The notebook includes:
- centroid initialization
- cluster assignment
- centroid updates
- convergence detection
- PCA visualization
- silhouette score evaluation

This part demonstrates an understanding of the internal mechanics of K-Means.
