# 🧠 Modern AI with Unsloth.ai — Assignment Series

This repository contains five Colab-based projects exploring fine‑tuning and reinforcement learning using **Unsloth.ai** and **LoRA adapters**.

## 📂 Folder Overview
| Folder | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `1. Full Finetuning with a small model` | Full model fine‑tuning of SmolLM2‑135M. |
| `2. LORA parameter` | Parameter‑efficient training using LoRA adapters. |
| `3. Reinforcement learning` | Preference optimization via DPO. |
| `4. Reinforcement learning with GRPO` | Self‑play reasoning (GRPO‑Lite). |
| `5. Continued pretraining` | LoRA merging, inference, and evaluation. |

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Google Colab (T4 GPU recommended)
- Libraries: transformers, datasets, accelerate, peft, trl

## 🚀 Highlights
- Efficient fine‑tuning with Unsloth.ai
- LoRA adapters for low‑resource environments
- Reinforcement learning via DPO & GRPO‑Lite
- FP32 precision for error‑free Colab execution
