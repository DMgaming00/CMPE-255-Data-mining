# 🧠 3. Reinforcement Learning — Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)

Implements **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** for reinforcement learning using LoRA adapters.

## 🧩 Process
1. Create a preference dataset with “chosen” and “rejected” answers.
2. Train model via `DPOTrainer` in reference‑free mode.
3. Evaluate post‑training performance.

## ✅ Features
- No reward model required.
- Simple and fast reinforcement learning.
- Works efficiently with LoRA adapters.
